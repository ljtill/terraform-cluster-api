# Cluster API

This repository provides the source code for setting up Cluster API on Microsoft Azure using Terraform and Flux. You can use this repository to create a fully automated and scalable workflow for deploying and managing Kubernetes clusters on Azure.

The purpose of the repository is to:

- Deploy the management cluster with Terraform
- Bootstrap it with Flux to pull in the Kubernetes manifests and apply them
- Install Cluster API on top of the management cluster
- Start deploying additional AKS clusters using Cluster API

Through the use of Flux, weâ€™re able to deploy workload clusters quickly after pull requests are merged. You can use this repository as a template or a reference for your own Cluster API projects on Azure.

## Repository structure

- `clusters` - Kustomize manifests for cluster components
  - `management` - Platform management cluster
  - `workloads` - Distributed workload clusters
- `manifests` - Re-usable Kubernetes manifests for all clusters
- `resources` - Terraform files for deploying the Management cluster

---

## Getting Started

Deploy Management Cluster

1. Navigate to the `resources` directory
2. Update `resource_name` and `location` properties in `locals.tf` file
3. Update `url` property in the `providers.tf` file
3. Authenticate Azure session `az login`
4. Select desired Azure subscription `az account set -s '{SubscriptionName}'`
5. Deploy Terraform resources `terraform deploy`
6. Authenticate Kubernetes context `az aks get-credentials -g '{ResourceGroup}' -n {Name}`

Create Cluster Federation

1. Browse to the [Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com/)
2. Create App registration
3. Navigate to Certificates & secrets
4. Add Federated credential "Kubernetes accessing Azure resources"
5. Provide cluster details
  - Cluster issuer URL `az aks show -g '{ResourceGroup}' -n '{Name}' --query 'oidcIssuerProfile.issuerUrl'`
  - Namespace `capi-azure-system`
  - Service account name `capz-manager`

Provision Workload Clusters*

1. Navigate to the `manifest/config` directory
2. Update the data properties with desired values
3. Deploy Kubernetes manifest `kubectl apply -f workloads.yaml`

*The configuration for the workloads is manually deployed but this could be handled by Flux.
